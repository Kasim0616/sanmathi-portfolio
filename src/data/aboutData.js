    description1:
        "My engineering journey started in India, where I gained hands-on exposure to field monitoring and environmental compliance. That experience taught me something important early on: engineering decisions don’t live on paper. They affect people, systems, and environments in very practical ways.",

    description2:
        "I later moved to Germany for my master’s in Water Resources Engineering, where my focus shifted toward applied research and development. There, I worked on hydraulic modelling, micropollutant treatment studies, and AI-assisted water quality monitoring tools. This phase shaped how I approach problems: structured, data-driven, and always tied back to real-world application.",

    description3:
        "I’m currently an Erasmus research intern in Norway, working on stormwater pollutant clearance and water quality analysis. My work involves processing complex environmental datasets, interpreting results, and supporting applied research projects that sit between academia and practice.",

    description4:
        "Working across three countries has made me adaptable, curious, and comfortable in new technical and cultural environments. I learn fast, ask questions, and take ownership of my work."
